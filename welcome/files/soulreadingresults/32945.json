MISDIRECTED<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>{FIRSTNAME}<\/strong>, I sense your soul is often misunderstood, with its sensitive, emotional center contained in a strong outer shield.<\/p>\n<p>Others may think you\u2019re pretty tough... all the way through to your core.<\/p>\n<p>And they may even be intimidated by your stern exterior\u2026 but I can tune into the truth\u2026 you\u2019re just not one to wear your heart on your sleeve. <\/p>\n<p>For this reason you may let issues fester, before you finally come out and say what\u2019s on your mind.<\/p>\n<p>Your soul tends to put focus instead on directing energy to other things\u2026 <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m sensing that you probably have a very enviable work ethic.<\/p>\n<p>And you are forever climbing the mountain of your ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>Something you\u2019re likely to agree with is that you don\u2019t like to do work that feels below your capabilities\u2026 always wanting to take on more challenging tasks to feel satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>Your soul adores order\u2026 and feels balanced when everything in your world is safely where it needs to be.<\/p>\n<p>Powerful souls take their work extremely seriously and can feel incredibly hurt when their hard work isn\u2019t recognized\u2026 <\/p>\n<p>This is a place where you can be held back\u2026 putting the opinions of the people closest to you on too high of a pedestal\u2026 and where negative energy can grow\u2026<\/p>\n<p>I intuitively feel that you\u2019ve always been incredibly hard working, putting your whole soul into a project until it\u2018s complete. <\/p>\n<p>But often you aren\u2019t fully rewarded for the amount of work you put into everything...<\/p>\n<p>I also sense that you are at a crossroads in your life regarding moving toward truly being rewarded for your years of investment in your future.<\/p>\n<p>From my reading today I feel that an additional \u201cEnergy Reading\u201d is necessary to find out exactly what\u2019s been
